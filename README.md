# Analyzing Daily Temperature Trends in New Bedford, Massachusetts
This project analyzes temperature data for the years 2021 and 2022, generating insights and visualizations based on the datasets provided. The repository is organized into four main folders: `code`, `data`, `graph`, and `report`.

# Repository Structure
- code: Contains the Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) with all the code for data analysis and visualization.
- data: Includes the .csv files used for the analysis (`02745_2021.csv` and `2022_02745.csv`).
- graph: Contains the generated graph images for each visualization.
- 6150_LMC_Individual_Proj_Report: A project report that breaks down the purpose of the project, its findings, and conclusions.

# Steps to execute the code
